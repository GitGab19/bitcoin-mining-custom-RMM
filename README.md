This repository contains my personal implementation of a custom RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) system for Bitcoin mining, which I developed for a single ASIC miner. <br> Monitoring of the activity is managed through different tools like Docker, Grafana, InfluxDB, Raspberry PI, ESP32 and various sensors.
