## Introduction

Repo contains a personal implementation of a custom ***Remote Monitoring and Management*** system for Bitcoin mining, which I developed during a prototyping phase project, with a single ASIC miner. <br> Monitoring of the activity is managed through different tools like Docker, Grafana, InfluxDB, Raspberry PI, ESP32 and various sensors.
